lvgl samples for the touch version of the Lilygo T-Display-S3

Here you will find the very first samples of the Lilygo T-Display-S3 cap (touch version). Explanation how the touch function is used 
can be seen in the attached pdf file. The mentioned sample is also attached. For better understanding I first did not use the lvgl library.
I just tried to find out how to use the touch function. So please read and use the ui_sample_1 and ui_sample_2 first.
At first I tried realizing a touch button and a slider, very simple sample. More complex and nicer samples will be added.

I would appriciate very much to get ideas for the usage of this relativly small screen!
